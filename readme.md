# Instax-BLE

An attempt at creating a script to control my Instax Mini Link photo printer over bluetooth.

Very much work in progress, not functional yet.

Borrows heavily from notes and ideas as discussed in [this thread](https://github.com/jpwsutton/instax_api/issues/21#issuecomment-1352639100).

Update:
It works! The final code is not in the online repo yet, but I will add it as soon I've been able to do some cleanup.
